Nashville Housing Data Cleaning

Overview

This project involves cleaning and standardizing a dataset of Nashville housing records using SQL. The tasks performed include:

Standardizing date formats
Populating missing property addresses
Breaking out addresses into individual columns (Address, City, State)
Converting categorical values (e.g., 'Y' and 'N' to 'Yes' and 'No' in the "Sold as Vacant" field)
Removing duplicate records
Dropping unnecessary columns
Objectives

The primary objective of this project was to ensure data quality and consistency, making the dataset more reliable for analysis and decision-making.

Key Skills Demonstrated

SQL for data cleaning and preprocessing
Use of CONVERT() and ALTER TABLE for data type conversions and schema modifications
Application of UPDATE statements to handle missing values
Utilization of JOIN operations to enrich data
Implementation of ROW_NUMBER() and CTE (Common Table Expressions) for removing duplicates
Conclusion

This project showcases a systematic approach to cleaning and preparing data for further analysis. The clean dataset can now be confidently used for various analytical purposes, ensuring accurate and reliable insights.
